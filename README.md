Lumozel
=======

Lumozel is intended to be a controller for live instrumentation, based primarily upon a variety of non-contact sensing methods. Lumozel is designed to be modular, and easily adaptable to other, perhaps non-musical, applications. It is also designed with the goal that it will be able to be played in such a way that someone with relatively little knowledge of musical theory can easily improvise.

Status
------

Currently, there is no stable release.
As of 2012-07-31, there is no compilable codebase.

Goals
-----

* To create an intuitive controller for live instrumentation.
* To design a method of "hinting" toward the rudiments of musical scale theory.
* To create a codebase that can be adapted toward other applications.
* To use reusable classes in the code, allowing for their use in other contexts.
* To create a software backend that will communicate with a variety of protocols, including OSC and MIDI.
* To eventually create a standalone hardware component that requires no connection to a host computer.
* To keep the entire codebase and schematics of the hardware publicly available.
