Lumozel
=======

Lumozel is intended to be a controller for live instrumentation, based primarily upon infrared distance sensing. The hope is that by using non-contact distance sensing to create an instrument, the Lumozel will be easily played, even with no prior knowledge of the principles of the instrument.

Status
------

Currently, there is no stable release.

Goals
-----

To create an intuitive controller, with a focus towards live instrumentation applications.
To create code that can be easily adapted.
To make a software backend for the controller that allows the controller to interface with other devices using a variety of protocols, including OSC and MIDI.
