Lumozel
=======

Lumozel is intended to be a controller for live instrumentation, based primarily upon infrared distance sensing. The hope is that by using non-contact distance sensing to create an instrument, the Lumozel will be easily played, even with no prior knowledge of the principles of the instrument.
