Body current sensing would be cool. Very cool.

Computer vision idea:
Align array of lasers pointing up, and have a camera with the same alignment.
Use CV to look for red dots, and plot their positions.

Make Lumozel standalone, with MIDI I/O, using standalone code running on Arduino.
Eliminating need for computer, and would be able to communicate directly with iOS devices/Android.
